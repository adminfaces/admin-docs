Admin Starters are sample projects to get you started with AdminFaces. Following are current starters, access their github `README` for running instructions:


* {link-admin-starter}[Admin Starter^]: The default starter is a simple JavaEE 6(+) application without any persistence layer. You can run it on a JavaEE 6 or newer server and also in http://wildfly-swarm.io/[wildfly-swarm^].

* {link-admin-starter-persistence}[Admin Starter Persistence^]: Admin Starter application with persistence layer based on Apache DeltaSpike Data module via <<Admin Persistence>>;

* {link-admin-starter-tomcat}[Admin Starter Tomcat^]: Admin Starter application for Tomcat; 

* {link-admin-starter-springboot}[Admin Starter SpringBoot^]: Admin Starter application using https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot^] and https://github.com/joinfaces/[JoinFaces^].

* {link-admin-starter-shiro}[Admin Starter Shiro^]: Admin Starter application using https://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro^] for authentication.

* {link-admin-starter-security}[Admin Starter Security^]: Admin Starter application using `JavaEE 8` https://javaee.github.io/security-spec/[security API^] for authentication and authorization.
